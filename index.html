        <p id="firstPara">Hi My name is Paulette Yigo. I am from Burkina Faso and have been living in New Jersey for
            the
            past 5
            years. I
            recently discovered a new passion for Tech and here I am trying to learn to code and build a new carrier
            for
            myself. It is a long and very passionate journey and I am ready for the challenges.

            Here are two images
            that represents me. I love learning new recepes.I hope to be able to have a food blog or a food chanel
            one
            day as a side hobby. My biggest joy will be to teach my daughters how to code and how to bake</p>
